<p>
atime  File Access Time
Access time shows the last time the data from a file was accessed  read by one of the Unix processes directly or through commands and scripts.
</p>

<p>
ctime  File Change Time
ctime also changes when you change file&#039;s ownership or access permissions. It will also naturally highlight the last time file had its contents updated.
</p>

<p>
mtime  File Modify Time
Last modification time shows time of the  last change to file&#039;s contents. It does not change with owner or permission changes, and is therefore used for tracking the actual changes to data of the file itself.
</p>
<pre class="code"># To see the atime, ctime, mtime, we can use stat
[pliu@localhost tmp]$ stat toto
