Hive has two types of tables which are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Managed Table (Internal Table)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> External Table</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let’s now discuss the Hive Internal tables vs External tables comparison.
</p>

<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="hive_managed_tables">Hive Managed Tables</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
It is also know an internal table. When we create a table in Hive, it by default manages the data. This means that Hive moves the data into its warehouse directory.
</p>

<p>
Managed Tables  When we load data into a Managed table, then Hive moves data into Hive warehouse directory.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre class="code">CREATE TABLE managed_table (dummy STRING);
LOAD DATA INPATH &#039;/user/tom/data.txt&#039; INTO table managed_table;</pre>

<p>
This moves the file hdfs:<em>user/tom/data.txt into Hive’s warehouse directory for the managed_table table, which is hdfs:</em>user/hive/warehouse/managed_table.
</p>

<p>
Further, if we drop the table using: 
</p>
<pre class="code">DROP TABLE managed_table</pre>

<p>
Then this will delete the table metadata including its data. The data no longer exists anywhere. This is what it means for HIVE to manage the data.
</p>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="hive_external_tables">Hive External Tables</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
We can also create an external table. It tells Hive to refer to the data that is at an existing location outside the warehouse directory.
</p>

<p>
we can control the creation and deletion of the data. The location of the external data is specified at the table creation time:
</p>
<pre class="code">CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE external_table(dummy STRING)
LOCATION &#039;/user/tom/external_table&#039;;
LOAD DATA INPATH &#039;/user/tom/data.txt&#039; INTO TABLE external_table;</pre>

<p>
Now, with the EXTERNAL keyword, Apache Hive knows that it is not managing the data. So it doesn’t move data to its warehouse directory. It does not even check whether the external location exists at the time it is defined. This very useful feature because it means we create the data lazily after creating the table.
</p>

<p>
The important thing to notice is that when we drop an external table, Hive will leave the data untouched and only delete the metadata.

<p>
In conclusion, Managed tables are like normal database table in which we can store data and query on. On dropping Managed tables, the data stored in them is also deleted and data is lost forever. While dropping External tables will delete metadata but not the data.
