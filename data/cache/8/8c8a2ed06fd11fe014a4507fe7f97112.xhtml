<div class="level1">

<p>
There are many ways to integrate Apache NiFi and Apache Spark.
</p>

<p>
We can call Apache Spark Streaming via S2S (Apache NiFi&#039;s Site to Site) or Kafka. If you want to execute a regular Apache Spark job, you can do that via Apache Livy which is included in HDP 2.6+. This is how Apache Zeppelin integrates with Apache Spark, so it&#039;s secure and a reasonable approach.
</p>

<p>
I use this approach when I want to use Spark to process part of my process in the middle of an Apache NiFi flow.
