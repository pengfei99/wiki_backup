<p>
For generating an SSH key pair, you need to use the ssh-keygen tool. There are two points you need to pay attention
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Beware, you may overite your existing ssh key</strong>. So before you start, check your ~/.ssh/ is empty. If not, you can choose another directory and file name. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you don&#039;t want a passphrase for your private key just press enter. If you set a passphrase, every time you do an ssh connection, you need to provide this passphrase</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Just follow this example to generate your ssh key pair
</p>
<pre class="code">
(base) [pliu@localhost tmp]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/pliu/.ssh/id_rsa): /tmp/myNewPriKey     
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /tmp/myNewPriKey.
Your public key has been saved in /tmp/myNewPriKey.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:xV2mnBP+6WF2XJ+SAi2cpfbv7HHOin6KWfMawR2JEmI pliu@localhost.localdomain
The key&#039;s randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|       E . .. o  |
|      . o.*+.*.  |
|         OooBo  .|
|        ..* .ooo+|
|        S  = +*.+|
|            ++.o |
|           + o.. |
|          + B.=  |
|         o.==*.o |
+----[SHA256]-----+
(base) [pliu@localhost tmp]$ ls                                
myNewPriKey   myNewPriKey.pub   
</pre>

<p>
Important Note: Never send your private key to someone else. If someone has your private key, you need to generate a new key pair.
