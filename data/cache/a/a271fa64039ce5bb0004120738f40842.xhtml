<div class="level2">

<p>
The <strong>Kerberos protocol</strong> is designed to provide reliable authentication over open and insecure networks where communications between the hosts belonging to it may be intercepted
</p>

<p>
The Kerberos server itself is known as the Key Distribution Center, or KDC. At a high level, it has three parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A database of the users and services (known as principals) that it knows about and their respective Kerberos passwords</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> An authentication server (AS) which performs the initial authentication and issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A Ticket Granting Server (TGS) that issues subsequent service tickets based on the initial TGT</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A user principal requests authentication from the AS. The AS returns a TGT that is encrypted using the user principal&#039;s Kerberos password, which is known only to the user principal and the AS. The user principal decrypts the TGT locally using its Kerberos password, and from that point forward, until the ticket expires, the user principal can use the TGT to get service tickets from the TGS. Service tickets are what allow a principal to access various services.
</p>

<p>
Because cluster resources (hosts or services) cannot provide a password each time to decrypt the TGT, they use a special file, called a keytab, which contains the resource principal&#039;s authentication credentials.
</p>

<p>
The set of hosts, users, and services over which the Kerberos server has control is called a realm.

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="naming_convention_of_the_principal">Naming convention of the principal</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In theory, A principal in Kerberos 5 is of the following type: component1/component2/…/componentN@REALM
</p>

<p>
But, in practice a maximum of two components are used. For example, an entry referring to a user the principal is the following type: Name[/Instance]@REALM
</p>

<p>
The instance is optional and is normally used to better qualify the type of user. For example administrator users normally have the admin instance. The following are examples of principals referred to users:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> toto@PENGFEI.ORG    </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> toto/admin@PENGFEI.ORG </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If, instead, the entries refer to services, the principals assume the following form: Service/Hostname@REALM
</p>

<p>
The first component is the name of the service, for example imap, AFS, ftp. Often it is the word host which is used to indicate generic access to the machine (telnet, rsh, ssh). The second component is the complete hostname (FQDN) of the machine providing the requested service. It is important that this component exactly matches (in lower case letters) the <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> reverse resolution of the application server&#039;s IP address. The following are valid examples of principals referring to services:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> imap/mbox.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> host/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> afs/example.com@EXAMPLE.COM</div>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- EDIT4 SECTION "Naming convention of the principal" [1915-3200] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="ticket">Ticket</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A ticket is something a client presents to an application server to demonstrate the authenticity of its identity. Tickets are issued by the authentication server and are encrypted using the secret key of the service they are intended for. Since this key is a secret shared only between the authentication server and the server providing the service, not even the client which requested the ticket can know it or change its contents. The main information contained in a ticket includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The requesting user&#039;s principal (generally the username);</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The principal of the service it is intended for;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The IP address of the client machine from which the ticket can be used. In Kerberos 5 this field is optional and may also be multiple in order to be able to run clients under NAT or multihomed.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The date and time (in timestamp format) when the tickets validity commences;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The ticket&#039;s maximum lifetime</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The session key (this has a fundamental role which is described below);</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each ticket has an expiration (generally 10 hours). This is essential since the authentication server no longer has any control over an already issued ticket. Even though the realm administrator can prevent the issuing of new tickets for a certain user at any time, it cannot prevent users from using the tickets they already possess. This is the reason for limiting the lifetime of the tickets in order to limit any abuse over time.

<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="kerberos_operation">Kerberos Operation</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Finally, having acquired the concepts described in the preceding paragraphs, it is possible to discuss how Kerberos operates. We&#039;ll do this by listing and describing each of the packets which go between the client and KDC and between client and application server during authentication. At this point, it is important to underline that an application server never communicates directly with the Key Distribution Center: the service tickets, even if packeted by TGS, reach the service only through the client wishing to access them. The messages we will discuss are listed below (see also the figure below):
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AS_REQ is the initial user authentication request (i.e. made with kinit) This message is directed to the KDC component known as Authentication Server (AS);</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AS_REP is the reply of the Authentication Server to the previous request. Basically it contains the TGT (encrypted using the TGS secret key) and the session key (encrypted using the secret key of the requesting user);</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> TGS_REQ is the request from the client to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) for a service ticket. This packet includes the TGT obtained from the previous message and an authenticator generated by the client and encrypted with the session key;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> TGS_REP is the reply of the Ticket Granting Server to the previous request. Located inside is the requested service ticket (encrypted with the secret key of the service) and a service session key generated by TGS and encrypted using the previous session key generated by the AS;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AP_REQ is the request that the client sends to an application server to access a service. The components are the service ticket obtained from TGS with the previous reply and an authenticator again generated by the client, but this time encrypted using the service session key (generated by TGS);</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AP_REP is the reply that the application server gives to the client to prove it really is the server the client is expecting. This packet is not always requested. The client requests the server for it only when mutual authentication is necessary.</div>
</li>
</ul>
