====== Install anaconda ======

===== Introduction =====

Anaconda is the most popular python data science and machine learning platform, used for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing. Anaconda distribution ships with more than 1,000 data packages, the conda command-line tool and with a desktop graphical user interface called Anaconda Navigator.

==== Anaconda vs Pip ====

Having been involved in the python world for so long, we are all aware of pip, easy_install, and virtualenv, but these tools did not meet all of our specific requirements. The main problem is that they are focused around Python, neglecting non-Python library dependencies, such as HDF5, MKL, LLVM, etc., which do not have a setup.py in their source code and also do not install files into Pythonâ€™s site-packages directory.

So Conda is a packaging tool and installer that aims to do more than what pip does; handle library dependencies outside of the Python packages as well as the Python packages themselves. Conda also creates a virtual environment, like virtualenv does.


Because Conda introduces a new packaging format, you cannot use pip and Conda interchangeably;  pip cannot install the Conda package format. You can use the two tools side by side (by installing pip with conda install pip) but they do not interoperate either.

===== Step1. Get the conda installer =====

You can get all available conda version at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section. In this tutorial we choose the current latest version Anaconda3-2018.12. The following code will download the installer 

<code>
cd /tmp
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh

# check the script checksum
sha256sum Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh 
1019d0857e5865f8a6861eaf15bfe535b87e92b72ce4f531000dc672be7fce00  Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh

# compare the above checksums with the checksum of the anaconda web site 
</code>

===== Step2. Run the anaconda installer =====

Before you run the installer, you need to know, anaconda will download and install a python 3.7.0 which will you overwrite all your python3.7 installation.

Anaconda installer needs some system dependencies to do the install, install the following dependencies

<code>
yum install -y bzip2 

# run the installer, it's not recommended to run with sudo. Choose the user who wishes to install conda 
sh Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh

# you will be prompted with a series of questions. based on your needs, answer yes or no.
Installation finished.

Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3
in your /home/linuxize/.bashrc ? [yes|no]

# I recommend you to enter yes

</code> 

The installer will also ask you whether you would like to download and install Visual Studio Code. You can find more information about Visual Studio on the website (https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you want to install Visual Studio Code type yes otherwise type no.

To activate the Anaconda installation load the new PATH environment variable which was added by the Anaconda installer into the current shell session with the following command:

<code>
source ~/.bashrc
</code>

===== Step3. Verify the conda installation =====

<code>
conda info
</code>

===== Step4. Updating Anaconda =====

<code>
# Updating the Anaconda is a pretty straight forward process, first update the conda tool with:
conda update anaconda

# Once conda is updated, proceed with the Anaconda update:
conda update anaconda
</code>

You should regularly update your Anaconda installation.

====== Deleting Anaconda ======

===== Step1. Remove the Anaconda install directory =====

<code>
# Find your anaconda installation path
rm -rf /path/to/anaconda3
</code>

===== Step2. Edit your ~/.bashrc =====
To remove conda from your path, you need to delete the lines which anaconda added, for example in my .bashrc
I have the following line

<code>
# added by Anaconda3 5.3.1 installer
# >>> conda init >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/home/linuxize/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    \eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/home/linuxize/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/home/linuxize/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
        CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base
    else
        \export PATH="/home/linuxize/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda init <<<
</code>

Delete them.

===== Step3. Remove the hidden files =====

The following command will remove the hidden files and folders that have been created by Anaconda in your user home directory:

<code>
rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum
</code>
