====== Soft skills for a computer scientiest ======

From my current job, I've learned the importance of soft skills. Before I was only focused on hard skills such as data structure, architecture, algorithm, technologies, etc.

But hard skills are not enough to get your work recognized.

Two books need to be read.

  - Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual
  - The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide
