====== Linux user account creation and group creation ======

All user account related information are stored in the following files:

  * Unordered List Item/etc/passwd – Contains one line for each user account.
  * /etc/shadow – Contains the password information in encrypted formatfor the system’s accounts and optional account aging information.
  * /etc/group – Defines the groups on the system.
  * /etc/default/useradd – This file contains a value for the default group, if none is specified by the useradd command.
  * /etc/login.defs – This file defines the site-specific configuration for the shadow password suite stored in /etc/shadow file.

===== List all available users in the linux =====

The below code will return all users (humain or process) of the linux system.

<code>
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
</code>

===== Create user account with all possible options =====

Most used option table

^ Option      ^ Action           ^
| -c    | Adds comment to the user account     | 
| -m    | Creates user home directory in default location, if nonexistent |
| -s    | Default shell other than /bin/bash     |
| -n    | Does not create a private group for the user, usually a group with username     |
|-r, --system| create a system account |

==== 1. create user account ====

<code>

# List all local users in your linux server
cut -d: -f1 /etc/password

sudo useradd pliu --uid 8888 --home /home/sweet_home/pliu/ --create-home --groups godTeam, bestDevs --gid bestMan 

-add user pliu
-uid is 8888
-user home /home/sweet_home/pliu/ 
-useradd will create user home
-user will be added two groups godTeam and bestDevs as second group
-user will be added group bestMan as primary group
</code>

==== 2. set up password ====

<code>
sudo passwd pliu

</code>

==== 3. Create a system account ====

<code>
# create a system account with a home dir
useradd -r kafka -m
</code>


===== Disabling user accounts  =====
There are several methods to disable accounts on a system. These range from editing the /etc/passwd file by hand. Or even using the passwd command with the -lswitch. Both of these methods have one big drawback: if the user has ssh access and uses an RSA key for authentication, they can still login using this method.

Now let’s use the chage command, changing the password expiry date to a previous date. Also, it may be good to make a note on the account as to why we disabled it.

<code>
[root@localhost Downloads]# chage -E 2005-10-01 bjones
 
[root@localhost Downloads]# usermod  -c "Disabled Account while Bob out of the country 
for five months" bjones

[root@localhost Downloads]# grep bjones /etc/passwd 
bjones:x:1001:1001:Disabled Account while Bob out of the country for four 
months:/home/bjones:/bin/bash

[root@localhost Downloads]#
</code>

===== Lock an account =====

If you don't want to a user to login an account, you can lock it and disable its shell. This happens when the account is a system or process account which runs a service or a tool.

<code>
sudo usermod -L <login>

# For locking zookeeper account
sudo usermod -L zk
</code>


===== Create group with all options =====

<code>
#this will create a group bestDevs with gid 8888
groupadd -g 8888 bestDevs

# all group info is stored in /etc/group
# getent can get entries from name service switch libraries
#show all groups and memebers in the system
getent group

# get info of a specific group/gid
getent group bestDevs
getent group 8888

</code>
==== create group with password ====

Let's make a new group called secret. We will add a password to the group, allowing the users to add themselves with a known password.

<code>
[root@localhost]# groupadd secret

[root@localhost]# gpasswd secret 
Changing the password for group secret 
New Password:  
Re-enter new password:

[root@localhost]# exit 
exit

[centos@localhost ~]$ newgrp secret 
Password:

[centos@localhost ~]$ groups 
secret wheel rdc

[centos@localhost ~]$
</code>

==== Modifier user account ====


usermod is used to update account attributes.

Following are the common usermod switches.

^ Option      ^ Action           ^
| -c    | Comment, updates the user comment value     | 
| -a    | Appends, adds user to supplementary groups, only with the -G option |
| -d    | Home directory, updates the user's home directory     |
| -G    | Groups, adds or removesthe secondary user groups     |
| -g    | Group, default primary group of the user     |

<code>
[root@localhost]# groups centos 
centos : accounting secret

# change the primary group of pliu to bioaster
[root@localhost]# usermod -g bioaster pliu

# add the secondary group wheel to user centos
[root@localhost]# usermod -a -G wheel centos

[root@localhost]# groups centos
centos : accounting wheel secret

[root@localhost]#
</code>

==== modify group  ====

''groupmod -g 8888 mygroup''

change gid of mygroup to 8888


==== Remove user ====

<code>
userdel pliu

#remove user and user home
userdel -r pliu
</code>

===== Default File Permissions (umask) =====

When you create a file or directory, the default file permissions assigned to the file or directory are controlled by the user mask. The user mask is set by the umask command in a user initialization file. You can display the current value of the user mask by typing umask and pressing Return.

The user mask contains the following octal values:
  * The first digit sets permissions for the user
  * The second sets permissions for group
  * The third sets permissions for other, also referred to as “world”

Note that if the first digit is zero, it is not displayed. For example, if umask is set to 022, 22 is displayed.

To determine the umask value you want to set, subtract the value of the permissions you want from 666 (for a file) or 777 (for a directory). The remainder is the value to use with the umask command. For example, suppose you want to change the default mode for files to 644 (rw-r--r--). The difference between 666 and 644 is 022, which is the value you would use as an argument to the umask command. 

If you have a umask 002, when you create a directory, it will have 775 (777-002). When you create a file, it will have 664(666-002) which means rw-rw-r.
