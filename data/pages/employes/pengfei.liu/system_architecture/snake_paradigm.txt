====== Snake System Design Principles ======

In this article, we will use the snake System Design Principles to design a video streaming system like Netflix.



===== What is the system design? =====

The system design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data model for the system to satisfy the specified requirements.


===== 1. Scenario: case/interface =====

The first letter S stands for Scenarios, in this step, we will find all scenarios which can happen in the system. 
In other word, we need to find out what are the typical use cases? What kind of abstraction do you provide?
What do the APIs look like?

==== Example ====


In our simple Netflix example, We will have the following scenarios:
  * User management (registration, login/logout, reset/recover password)
  * Play a video
  * Video recommendation for a User

Of course, you can have more than these three above scenarios in your system. You need to list them one by one.

For each scenario, we need to list all detail actions. For example, to play a video, you may :
  * get the channel list
  * get into the channel
  * get video list of a channel
  * play a video

You can consider this step as the functional requirements gathering.

===== 2. Necessary: constrain/hypothesis =====

In this step, we need to find out the non-functional requirements such as:
  * How many total users and daily active users do you have?
  * How many transactions do you have?
  * How many concurrencies or parallel executions does it require?
  * How much is the peak load?
  * How fast does it have to be? Or how much latency can it endure

Based on these requirements, we need to design the system with enough cpu, memory, storage, database connections.

==== Example ====

Let's reuse the netflix example, the PM told us we will have the following user load:

Total User connection per day : 5,000,000

The Average connection duration is: 30 mins

The average concurrent user connection(= Total user connection per day/ 24h (in seconds) * connection duration (in seconds)): 5000000/(24*60*60)*(30*60) = 104167

Max concurrent user connection(The average * 6) = 625000

We estimate, six months later, we will double this number = 1,250,000

**Band width** : 
per user = 3 mbps

max = 3 * 1,250,000 (max concurrent user connection)

**Memory** :

per user = 10 kb

now max= total user number * 10kb = 

6 month later max = total user number * 2 * 10kb

** Hard drive **

Movie number = 1000

Each movie takes 50 GB

Total: 1000* 50 = 50 TB


===== 3. Application: service/algorithm =====

Design the architecture of each service in the application, and evaluate the Complexity(Big O analysis) of each service.

Simulate use cases step by step by using the given service (find out all possible service chaining combination)

==== Example ====

In our Netflix example, we can think of three basic services:

  * user service
  * channel service
  * movie service


===== 4. Kilobit: data =====

In this step, we need to identify all services which need to persist data and evaluate the following questions:
  * How much is the generated data?
  * How much space does it need to persist?
  * Where to store the data. File system? SQL database? NoSQL database?

==== Example ====

**User service**

The user service will persist user data, such as user name, age, and role, etc. With a SQL database, we can reduce the storage, because of the user role table will be reused by all users.

**Channel service**
It depends on how we design a channel, if a movie can be in multiple channels, SQL database is better, otherwise, 
NoSql is better

**Movie service**
It requires both sql database and file storage.

===== 5. Evolve: =====

In this step, we need to analyze the architecture and answer the following question:
  * Is there still Optimization possible
  * Is it Extensibable(adding new features)
  * Is it Scalabable(support more user)
  * Does it support high Availability
