===== DL-NER annotator =====

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

For example, in a sentence, we have "Obama is the president of USA." Obama and USA are named entities, but president is not.
