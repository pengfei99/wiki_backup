====== CAP theorem ======

In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:

  * Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
  * Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response â€“ without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
  * Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

In particular, the CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability. Note that consistency, as defined in the CAP theorem, is quite different from the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions.
