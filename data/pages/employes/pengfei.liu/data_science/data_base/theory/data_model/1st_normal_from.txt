====== First normal form ======

First normal form (1NF) is a property of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in first normal form if and only if the table have the following qualities: 

  * The table is two-dimensional with rows and columns.
  * Each row contains data that pertains to some thing or portion of a thing.
  * Each column contains data for a single attribute of the thing itâ€™s describing.
  * Each cell (intersection of a row and a column) of the table must have only a single value.
  * Entries in any column must all be of the same kind. If, for example, the entry in one row of a column contains an employee name, all the other rows must contain employee names in that column, too.
  * Each column must have a unique name.
  * No two rows may be identical (that is, each row must be unique).
  * The order of the columns and the order of the rows are not significant.

First normal form is an essential property of a relation in a relational database. Database normalization is the process of representing a database in terms of relations in standard normal forms, where first normal is a minimal requirement.

First normal form enforces these criteria:

  * Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.
  * Create a separate table for each set of related data.
  * Identify each set of related data with a primary key.




===== Wrong Example =====

The following table does not respect the 1NF norm, because the phone number column contains multiple values. 

^ID^First_Name^Last_Name^Phone number^
|1|foo|bar|555-2334-3234, 134-34454-0345|
|2|toto|zoo|666-2334-3234, 13-34454-0345|


The following version respects the 1NF norm.

^ID^First_Name^Last_Name^Phone_number1^Phone_number2^
|1|foo|bar|555-2334-3234| 134-34454-0345|
|2|toto|zoo|666-2334-3234| 13-34454-0345|

But this design does not work with users who have 3 phone numbers. 

A better design is to separate the phone number from the custom table

^Customer_ID^First_Name^Last_Name^
|1|foo|bar|
|2|toto|zoo|

^Phone_ID^Customer_ID^Phone_number^
|1|1|555-2334-3234|
|2|1|134-34454-0345|
|3|2|666-2334-3234| 
|4|2|13-34454-0345|

The custom name use Customer_ID to form a one to many relation between customer table and phone number table.

But we can't use Customer ID as primary key, Because it's not unique in the cloumn anymore.
