====== Lesson05 SQL joining Data ======

To combine data from different tables, we need to join these data with a join clause. A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. In this lesson, we will show you a brief overview of joins.

===== 5.1 Different join types =====

In general, we have the following join types:
  * Inner Join – selects rows from one table that have the corresponding rows in other tables.
  * Left (OUTER) Join – selects rows from one table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables.
  * Right (OUTER) Join - Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
  * Self-join – joins a table to itself by comparing a table to itself.
  * Full Outer Join – returns all records when there is a match in either left table or right table records.
  * Cross Join – produces a Cartesian product of the rows in two or more tables.
  * Natural Join – joins two or more tables using implicit join condition based on the common column names in the joined tables.

===== 5.2 Inner Join =====

A Inner Join selects rows from one table that have the corresponding rows in other tables. The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. 

For example, we have two tables:
Orders:
   * OrderID
   * CustomerID
   * OrderDate

Customers:
    * CustomerID
    * CustomerName
    * ContactName
    * Country

<code>
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
</code>
If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

===== 5.3 Left/Right join =====

Left Join returns all rows from the left table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables. The columns of the right side table in the result table will be NULL if there is no match.

Right Join returns all rows from the right table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables. The columns of the left side table in the result table will be NULL if there is no match.

Note: In some database implementations, Left/right join are called Left/Right OUTER JOIN.

==== Examples ====

<code>
# This left join will return all rows in Orders if there are no corresponding rows in Customers, the Customers.CustomerName column will be NULL.

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

# This right join will return all rows in Customers if there are no corresponding rows in Orders, the Orders.OrderID and Orders.OrderDate column will be NULL

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
</code>

===== 5.4 Self Join =====

Self-join joins a table to itself. Self-joins are useful for comparing values in a column of rows within the same table. 

==== Examples ====

Suppose we have a table Customers and it has the following columns
Customers:
    * CustomerID
    * CustomerName
    * ContactName
    * Country
    * City

We want to find all customers which are from the same city.

<code>
# explicite self join
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A inner join Customers B on A.City = B.City
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
ORDER BY A.City;

# implicite self join
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City 
ORDER BY A.City;

# Note that, two above sql commands will return the same result. If you replace inner join with left or right, it will not change anything, it will return the same result.
</code>

===== 5.5 Full Outer Join =====

Full Outer Join returns all records when there is a match in either left table or right table records. For rows which the left/right side table does not have a match, the columns of the left/right side table in the result table will be NULL.


==== Examples ====

We reuse the two table of the inner join example, the below sql query will return all rows of the table orders and customers, if there are a match, all the column value of these match rows in the result table will be from the two tables. If no match, the column value will be NULL.
<code>
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
FULL OUTER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
</code> 

Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets, for example, if there are n rows in Orders, and m rows in Customers, the result will have n+m rows
 
===== 5.6 Cross Join =====

Cross Join produces the Cartesian Product of rows in two or more tables. Each row from the 1st table is combined with each row from the 2nd one. Different from the other JOIN operators, the CROSS JOIN does not have any matching condition in the join clause.

<code>
# a standard cross join query
SELECT * FROM A CROSS JOIN B

# an implicit cross join query
SELECT * FROM A, B

# another implicit cross join query
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON TRUE
</code>

Note: CROSS JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets, for example, if there are n rows in Orders, and m rows in Customers, the result will have n*m rows

===== 5.7 Natural Join =====

Natural Join creates an implicit join based on the same column names in the joined tables. A natural join can be an inner join, left join, or right join. If you do not specify a join explicitly, the INNER JOIN is used by default.

If wildcard * is used in the select list, the result will contain the following columns: 
  * All the common columns, which are the columns in both tables that have the same name
  * Every column in the first and second tables that is not a common column

For example, we have two tables:
tableA(c1,c2,c3), tableB(c4,c1,c5) 

A natural join will return a table (c1,c2,c3,c4,c5)
<code>
# A standard natural join
Select * from A NATURAL JOIN B

# equivalent inner join
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B USING (c1)
</code>

Note: The convenience is that it does not require you to specify the join clause because it uses an implicit join clause based on the common column. Avoid using it whenever possible because it may cause an unexpected result.

===== 5.9 Union =====

The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. The following are rules applied to the queries:
  * Both queries must return the same number of columns.
  * The corresponding columns in the queries must have compatible data types.
  * Removes all duplicate rows Unless the UNION ALL is used.
  * No order. To sort the rows in the combined result set by a specified column, you use the ORDER BY clause.

==== Example ====

Suppose we have two tables(e.g. customers, suppliers), and they both have a column named city. We have to have the full list of city of both tables.

<code>
# This command will return the full city list and remove the duplicates
SELECT City FROM Customers 
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

# This command will return the full city list and keep the duplicates
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

# The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;

# To know the rows are from which table, we can use the following technique
SELECT 'Customer' As Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers

# Type	ContactName	City	Country
# Customer	Alejandra Camino	Madrid	Spain
# Supplier	Anne Heikkonen	Lappeenranta	Finland

# Note that the 'Customer', 'Supplier' are constant which will be added in each row of the supplier and customer.
# The second select statement will use the column name of the first select statement, so the order of the column name of the two select statements must be a match. 
# For example, the following query will return 
SELECT 'Customer' As Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, Country, City
FROM Suppliers

# Type	ContactName	City	Country
# Customer	Alejandra Camino	Madrid	Spain
# Supplier	Anne Heikkonen		Finland Lappeenranta
</code>

===== 5.10 Intersect =====

The INTERSECT operator combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. The INTERSECT operator returns any rows that are available in both result set or returned by both queries. The following are rules applied to the queries:
  * The number of columns and their order in the SELECT clauses must be the same.
  * The data types of the columns must be compatible

To sort the result set returned by the INTERSECT operator, place the ORDER BY clause at the end of the statement. 

Note that, MySQL does not support the INTERSECT operator. Because the use of intersect is not so popular.

<code>
# The sql query is very similar to union
SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

INTERSECT

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]
</code>

===== 5.11 EXCEPT =====
The SQL EXCEPT operator returns the rows in the first query that do not appears in the output of the second query.
It returns rows by comparing the result sets of two or more queries. To combine the queries using the EXCEPT operator:
  * The number of columns & their orders must be the same in the 2 queries.
  * The data types of the respective columns must be compatible.

To sort the result set returned by the EXCEPT operator, place the ORDER BY clause at the end of the statement. 
Note that, in oracle and mysql, the except clause is replaced by **MINUS**.

<code>
SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

EXCEPT

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]
</code>

===== 5.12 Grouping Sets =====
By definition, a grouping set is a group of columns by which you group. Typically, a single query with an aggregate defines a single grouping set. The GROUPING SETS OPERATOR generates a result set equivalent to which generated by the UNION ALL of the multiple GROUP BY clauses.

But why we use grouping sets instead of UNION ALL? 
There are two major problems:
  * The query is quite lengthy
  * The query is slow because SQL Server needs to execute four queries and combine the result sets into a single one.

<code>
# The general syntax of the grouping sets:
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    aggregate_function (column3)
FROM
    table_name
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS (
        (column1, column2),
        (column1),
        (column2),
        ()
);

# Note that, the grouping set works on a signle table
# The above sql query returns four grouping sets (column1,column2), (column1), (column2), ()
</code>

==== GROUPING function ====

The GROUPING function indicates whether a specified column in a GROUP BY clause is aggregated or not. It returns 1 for aggregated or 0 for not aggregated in the result set.

==== Examples  ====

Suppose we have a table called sales_summary in schema sales, and it has four columns (e.g. brand, category, model_year, sales). The manager wants to know the sales number of each brand and category. 

1. So first, we need to get the sales group by brand and category with the following query

<code>
SELECT brand, category, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY brand, category
ORDER BY brand, category;

# it will return something like
# brand  |  category | sales
# Electra|  Children Bicycles | 207606,00
# Electra|  Cruisers Bicycles | 694909,00
# Haro   | Mountain Bikes | 171459,00
# Trek   | Electric Bikes | 838372,00
# Trek   | Mountain Bikes | 184770,00
</code>

2. The manager said it's great, but he also needs to know the sales of each brand, the following query will return that
<code>
SELECT brand, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY brand;

# it will return something like
# brand  |  sales
# Electra|  1207606,00
# Haro   |  1851459,00
# Trek   |  4602754,00
</code>

3. The manager also wants to know the sales of each category, the following query will return that

<code>
SELECT category, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category;

# it will return something like
# category | sales
# Children Bicycles | 1207606,00
# Cruisers Bicycles | 2694909,00
# Mountain Bikes | 3171459,00
# Electric Bikes | 1838372,00

</code>

4. The manager wants to know the total sales.

<code>
SELECT SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary;

# it will return something like
#  sales
# 7689113,00
</code>

5. The manager wants to know can we put the above result in a single result table. We know we have four grouping sets: (brand, category), (brand), (category), (). The first solution is to use the UNION ALL clause. As union all requires all select statement has the same number and order of columns, we need to add NULL in the last three queries. The full SQL query:

<code>
SELECT brand, category, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY brand, category
UNION ALL
SELECT brand, NULL, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY brand
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, category, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY category
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, NULL, SUM (sales)
FROM sales.sales_summary
ORDER BY brand, category;
</code>

We can notice that the query is quite long, and we will have performance issues, because we execute four queries on the same table and combine the result sets. In this kind of scenario, we need to use the grouping sets clause.

<code>
SELECT brand, category, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
 GROUPING SETS ((brand, category),(brand),(category),())
ORDER BY brand, category;

# The above query will return the same result as the Union all query. However, this query is much more readable and of course more efficient.
</code>

6. Finally, the manager wants to know if the sales value of one row is the result of aggregation or not. We need to modify a little bit our query as followed:
<code>
SELECT 
GROUPING(brand) grouping_brand,
GROUPING(category) grouping_category,
brand, category, SUM (sales) sales
FROM sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
 GROUPING SETS ((brand, category),(brand),(category),())
ORDER BY brand, category;

# We add two more columns to indicate that if the sales value is the result of brand or category column aggregation
# it will return something like
# grouping_brand | grouping_category |  brand  |  category | sales
#   1     |     1    | NULL  | NULL  | 7689113,00
#   1     |     0    | NULL  |  Children Bicycles | 292189,00
#   0     |     1    |Electra| NULL  | 1205321,00
#   0     |     0    |Haro   | Mountain Bikes | 171459,00

# The first line is the sum of all brand and all category, so it's the result of category and brand aggregation.
# The second line is the sum of all brand and Children Bicycles category, so it's only the result of brand aggregation.
# The third line is the sum of brand Electra and all category, so it's only the result of category aggregation
# The fouth line is the sum of brand Haro and category Moutain Bikes, so it's no aggregation on brand and category.
</code>



===== 5.13 Sub queries =====

A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the WHERE clause. A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved. Subqueries can be used with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements along with the operators like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN, etc. 

There are a few rules that subqueries must follow:
  * Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses.
  * A subquery can have only one column in the SELECT clause unless multiple columns are in the main query for the subquery to compare its selected columns.
  * An ORDER BY command cannot be used in a subquery, although the main query can use an ORDER BY. The GROUP BY command can be used to perform the same function as the ORDER BY in a subquery.
  * Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators such as the IN operator.
  * The SELECT list cannot include any references to values that evaluate to a BLOB, ARRAY, CLOB, or NCLOB.
  * A subquery cannot be immediately enclosed in a set function.
  * The BETWEEN operator cannot be used with a subquery. However, the BETWEEN operator can be used within the subquery.

<code>
# The general syntax
SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM   table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE  column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   [WHERE])
   
# Use subquery in an insert statement
INSERT INTO table_name [ (column1 [, column2 ]) ]
   SELECT [ *|column1 [, column2 ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   [ WHERE VALUE OPERATOR ] 

# Use subquery in a update statement   
UPDATE table
SET column_name = new_value
[ WHERE OPERATOR [ VALUE ]
   (SELECT COLUMN_NAME
   FROM TABLE_NAME)
   [ WHERE) ]   
</code>

==== Example ====

Suppose we have a table Customers which has five columns: (ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY)

1. We want to get all customers whose salary is above average.
<code>
# In this case, the subquery returns only one value, so we don't need to use IN
Select * from Customers where SALARY > (select avg(SALARY) from Customers)
</code>

2. We want to get all customers whose salary is above 4500.

<code>
# In this case, the subquery returns 0 or more values, we need to use IN
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 4500) ;

# Note that we can get the result without using the subquery, the above query is only for demo
</code>

3. We want to create a backup table of the Customers table

<code>
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS_BKP SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS  WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM CUSTOMERS) ;
</code>

4. We have CUSTOMERS_BKP table available which is backup of CUSTOMERS table. The following example updates SALARY by 0.25 times in the CUSTOMERS table for all the customers whose AGE is greater than or equal to 27.

<code>
UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET SALARY = SALARY * 0.25 WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >= 27 );
</code>

5. The following example deletes the records from the CUSTOMERS table for all the customers whose AGE is greater than or equal to 27.

<code>
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >= 27 );
</code>
