====== Spark ML Introductions ======

MLlib standardizes APIs for machine learning algorithms to make it easier to combine multiple algorithms into a single pipeline, or workflow. This section covers the key concepts introduced by the Pipelines API, where the pipeline concept is mostly inspired by the scikit-learn project.

**DataFrame**: This ML API uses DataFrame from Spark SQL as an ML dataset, which can hold a variety of data types. E.g., a DataFrame could have different columns storing text, feature vectors, true labels, and predictions.

**Transformer**: A Transformer is an algorithm which can transform one DataFrame into another DataFrame. E.g., an ML model is a Transformer which transforms a DataFrame with features into a DataFrame with predictions.

**Estimator**: An Estimator is an algorithm which can be fit on a DataFrame to produce a Transformer. E.g., a learning algorithm is an Estimator which trains on a DataFrame and produces a model.

**Pipeline**: A Pipeline chains multiple Transformers and Estimators together to specify an ML workflow.

**Parameter**: All Transformers and Estimators now share a common API for specifying parameters.
