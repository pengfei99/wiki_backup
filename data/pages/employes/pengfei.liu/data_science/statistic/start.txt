====== Statistic docs ======
Basic concepts:

  * Normal Distributions
  * Standard Deviations and Variance: 
  * Modality : The modality of a distribution is determined by the number of peaks it contains. Most distributions have only one peak but it is possible that you encounter distributions with two or more peaks.
  * Skewness
  * Kurtosis : Kurtosis measures whether your dataset is heavy-tailed or light-tailed compared to a normal distribution. Data sets with high kurtosis have heavy tails and more outliers and data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails and fewer outliers. 

Note If a distribution is skewed, no need to calculate Kurtosis, because the distribution is not normally distributed.

===== Moments =====

Moments are a specific quantitative measure of the shape of the data. In statistics, moments are used to understand the various characteristics of a probability distribution. usually, we use moments to characterize the data, identify the shape of normal distribution. Moments are used measure to the central tendency, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis of a distribution.

==== Central tendency ====

This is nothing but Mean, it's the average value of a distribution. 

==== Dispersion ====

This is nothing but Variance, which is a measure that how far the data set is spread out.

==== skewness ====
