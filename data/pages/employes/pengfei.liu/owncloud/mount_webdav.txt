**I have tested this, it's not good idea. Because, at boot stage, you don't have internet connections alreay, it may result to error.**

7. Known issues

  - You may have this as warning message, /sbin/mount.davfs: warning: the server does not support locks

You can add ''use_locks 0'' in /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf

  - To avoid answer y for accepting servcer certificates. Copy server-certificate.pem to /etc/davfs2/certs/. Then edit /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf and uncomment the line servercert ''servercert /etc/davfs2/certs/server-certificate.pem''
