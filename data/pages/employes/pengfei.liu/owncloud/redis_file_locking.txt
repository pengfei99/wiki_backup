====== Use redis for file blocking ======


Additional notes for Redis vs. APCu on Memory Caching

APCu is faster at local caching than Redis. If you have enough memory, use APCu for memory caching and <color #ed1c24>Redis for file locking</color>. If you are low on memory, use Redis for both.

<code>
yum install epel-release
yum update
# install redis server
yum install redis
# install php71 redis driver
php71w-pecl-redis

#start redis
systemctl start/stop/status/restart redis

#run redis at bootup
systemctl enable redis

#verify redis, it should answer PONG
redis-cli ping

</code>

===== Persistence Options =====

Redis provides two options for disk persistence:

Point-in-time snapshots of the dataset, made at specified intervals (RDB).

Append-only logs of all the write operations performed by the server (AOF).

Each option has its own pros and cons which are detailed in the Redis documentation. For the greatest level of data safety, consider running both persistence methods.

Because the Point-in-time snapshot persistence is enabled by default, you only need to set up AOF persistence:

<code>
#Edit /etc/redis.conf, change the following lines
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
</code>
Restart redis to make it effective


===== Basic System Tuning =====

To improve Redis performance, set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1:

''sudo sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1''

This immediately changes the overcommit memory setting, but the change will not persist across reboots. To make it permanent, add vm.overcommit_memory = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf:

<code>
sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf

vm.overcommit_memory = 1

</code>

==== Edit config.php for owncloud to use redis ====


<code>
'memcache.locking' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\Redis',
  'redis' => 
  array (
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'port' => 6379,
  ),
</code>
