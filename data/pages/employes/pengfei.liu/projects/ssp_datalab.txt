====== SSP DataLab ======

service statistique public (SSP) datalab is realized inside INSEE. Its objective is to provide a platform for data scientist.   

The challenge is to create a cloud based platform which provides tools and techniques for data storage, cleaning, analysis, and so on. 


===== Tech choice =====

We have choose **containers** instead of **Virtual Machines**.

Containers are often compared to Virtual Machines (VMs), since both of them allow multiple types of software to be run in contained environments.

Containers are an abstraction of the application layer (meaning that each container simulates a different software application). Though each container runs isolated processes, multiple containers share a common Operating System.

VMs are an abstraction of the hardware layer (meaning that each VM simulates a physical machine that can run software). VM technology can use one physical server to run the equivalent of many servers (each of which is called a VM). So, while multiple VMs run on one physical machine, each VM has its own copy of an Operating System, applications and their related files, libraries and dependencies.

Running software in containerized environments generally uses less space and memory than running software within different VMs, since the latter requires a separate copy of the Operating System to run on each VM.


===== SSP datalab(cloud) architecture =====

The core of SSP datalab is a web application called **ONYXIA**. It has an api backend which can connect to a k8s or mesos cluster and a UI which allows users to deploy services on the backend container cluster.
