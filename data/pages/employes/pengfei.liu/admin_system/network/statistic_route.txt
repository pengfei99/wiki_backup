====== Statistic route ======

===== Introduction =====


Let us use the following sample network architecture for the rest of the examples.

In the diagram below, we have 2 individual networks ( 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.3.0, with subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 ).

We also have a “GATEWAY” machine with 3 network cards. 1st card is connected to 192.168.1.0, 2nd card is connected to 192.168.3.0, and the 3rd card is connected to the external world.

===== Introduction of route command =====

Route command is used to show/manipulate the IP routing table. It's primarily used to setup static routes to specific host or networks via an interface.

<code>
# route shows the details of the kernel routing table entries
[root@host-134-158-37-11 pliu]$ route

# to view the real ip address of the server instead of the server name
[root@host-134-158-37-11 pliu]$ route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         134.158.37.254  0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0
134.158.37.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 eth0

# Kernel maintains the routing cache information to route the packets faster. We can list the kernel’s routing cache information by using the -C flag.

==== Add a default gateway ====


<code>
route add default gw 192.168.1.10
</code>



===== Make 192.168.3.* Accessible from 192.168.1.* =====



===== Client ssh config =====
