====== Install python without using pyenv ======

1. Pre-install

yum group install "Development Tools" 

2. Get the source 

wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz

3. Untar the source

tar xzf Python-3.5.1.tgz
cd Python-3.5.1

4. Build make file

<code>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared
</code>

PS : --enable-shared option is crutial for build wsgi with apache. So if you don't add this option, you can't compile wsgi.

5. Install

make altinstall

6. Test

#  python3.5 â€“V

The executable are in /usr/local/bin, the dependence are in /usr/local/lib (or maybe /usr/local/lib64)


Ps. if you see error like /usr/local/bin/python: error while loading shared libraries:libpython3.5m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


You need to add export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

To make permenant, you have two options.
  * Make it work only for you, open your **.bash_profile** file, and add the following line **export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib**
  * Make it work for all users. In **/etc/ld.so.conf.d/**, create a file "python3.5-lib.conf". Then put the path of your python lib in it. For example, in my case, it's **/usr/local/lib**. Finally , run **sudo ldconfig**

7. Determin if your python is 32 or 64 bits

import struct

print (struct.calcsize("P") * 8)
