====== 1. Docker basic concepts ======

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

  * Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
  * Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
  * Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
  * Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  * Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  * Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

===== 1.1 Docker file, images and containers =====

  - **A Docker file** is a text file that Docker reads in from top to bottom. It contains a bunch of instructions that inform Docker HOW the Docker image should get built.
  - **A Docker image** gets built by running a Docker command (which uses the Dockerfile). An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
  - **A Docker container** is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with a state, or a user process). You can see a list of your running containers with the command, docker ps, just as you would in Linux.

===== 1.2 Container Host and the Container OS =====

  * **Container Host**: Also called the **Host OS**. The Host OS is the operating system on which the Docker client and Docker daemon run. **In the case of Linux and non-Hyper-V containers**, the Host OS shares its kernel with running Docker containers. **For Hyper-V each container has its own Hyper-V kernel**.
  * **Container OS**: Also called the **Base OS**. The base OS refers to a docker image that contains an operating system such as Ubuntu, CentOS, or windowsservercore. Typically, you would build your own image on top of a Base OS image so that you can take utilize parts of the OS. **Note that containers run on windows require a Base OS, while Linux containers do not.**
  * **Operating System Kernel**: The Kernel manages lower level functions such as memory management, file system, network and process scheduling.

==== 1.2.1 Linux Container example  ====

{{:employes:pengfei.liu:admin_system:container:docker:docker_linux_container.png?400|}}

In the above example

  * The Host OS is Ubuntu.
  * The Docker Client and the Docker Daemon (together called the Docker Engine) are running on the Ubuntu.
  * Each container shares the Host OS kernel.
  * CentOS and BusyBox are Linux Base OS images.
  * The “No OS” container demonstrates that you do not NEED a base OS to run a container in Linux. You can create a Docker file that has a base image of scratch and then runs a binary that uses the kernel directly.
  * Check out this article(https://brianchristner.io/docker-image-base-os-size-comparison/) for a comparison of Base OS sizes.

==== 1.2.2 Windows container without Hyper-V example ====
{{:employes:pengfei.liu:admin_system:container:docker:docker_windows_container_no_hyper_v.png?400|}}

In the above example
  * The Host OS is Windows 10 or Windows Server.
  * Each container shares the Host OS kernel.
  * All windows containers require a Base OS of either nanoserver or windowsservercore.

==== 1.2.3 Windows container with Hyper-V example====

{{:employes:pengfei.liu:admin_system:container:docker:docker_windows_container_with_hyper_v.png?400|}}

In the above example

  * The Host OS is Windows 10 or Windows Server.
  * Each container is hosted in its own light weight Hyper-V VM.
  * Each container uses the kernel inside the Hyper-V VM which provides an extra layer of separation between containers.
  * All windows containers require a Base OS of either nanoserver or windowsservercore.

===== 1.3 Docker advantage =====

Containerization makes CI/CD seamless. For example:

  * applications have no system dependencies
  * updates can be pushed to any part of a distributed application
  * resource density can be optimized.

With Docker, scaling your application is a matter of spinning up new executables, not running heavy VM hosts.

====== 2. Containers Vs virtual machines ======

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.
