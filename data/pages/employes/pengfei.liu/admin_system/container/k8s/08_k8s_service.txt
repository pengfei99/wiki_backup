====== 08: K8s services ======

Service is an abstract way to **expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service** (Micro-service).

Each Pod gets its own IP address, however, the Deployment does not provide a way to provide the service of these pods. For example, if I have two deployments one called backend and one called frontend. They both have multiple pods. How frontend knows which backend pod to use through the backend deployment. 

So we need another abstraction of the backend pod to provide service.

If you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for **Endpoints**, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes.

<code>
kubectl get endpoints -n user-pengfei
</code>
