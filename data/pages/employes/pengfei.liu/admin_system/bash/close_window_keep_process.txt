====== Close window without killing the process ======

The best way to do it is using screen.

The below script works too

<code>
nohup sh myexe.sh &
</code>

<code>
sh myexe.sh &
disown
</code>

====== Background/Forground process ======

<code>
# When you run a process with & at the end, the process will run at the background
# fg will bring the last process back to foreground 
fg
# if you have more than one process running in the background, use jobs to list all your back ground process
jobs
[1]   Stopped                 vim
[2]-  Stopped                 bash
[3]+  Stopped                 vim 23
# for example if you want to bring process 2 (bash) to forground
fg %2

# ctrl+z will suspend the process and send it to background
# bg will resume the process in the background
# if you have many process in background, you can use 
bg %2

</code>
