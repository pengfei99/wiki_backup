====== Configure yum and manage Yum repo ======

===== Configure yum =====

The configuration information for yum and related utilities is located at /etc/yum.conf. This file contains one mandatory [main] section, which enables you to set yum options that have a global effect, and can also contain one or more [repository] sections, which allow you to set repository-specific options. However, it is recommended to define individual repositories in new or existing .repo files in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. The values you define in individual [repository] sections of the /etc/yum.conf file override values set in the [main] section.

An example of the yum main configuration

<code>
[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever
keepcache=0
debuglevel=2
logfile=/var/log/yum.log
exactarch=1
obsoletes=1
gpgcheck=1
plugins=1
installonly_limit=3
bugtracker_url=http://bugs.centos.org/set_project.php?project_id=23&ref=http://bugs.centos.org/bug_report_page.php?category=yum
distroverpkg=centos-release

</code>

You can get all the option explanation from this address: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sec-configuring_yum_and_yum_repositories

==== Viewing the Current Configuration ====

Once, your configuration is done. To display the current values of global yum options (that is, the options specified in the [main] section of the /etc/yum.conf file), execute the yum-config-manager command with no command-line options:

<code>
yum-config-manager
</code>


===== Manage your yum repo =====

==== Adding, Enabling, and Disabling a yum repository ====

To define a new repository, you can either add a [repository] section to the /etc/yum.conf file, or to a .repo file in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. All files with the .repo file extension in this directory are read by yum.

Note it is recommended to define your repositories in a .repo and put it in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory instead of in /etc/yum.conf.

Warning: The repo must be trusted, otherwise it could lead to security, stability issues.

Yum repositories commonly provide their own .repo file. To add such a repository to your system and enable it, run the following command as root:

<code>
# repository_url is a link to the .repo file
yum-config-manager --add-repo repository_url

# adding an exmaple repo
yum-config-manager --add-repo http://www.example.com/example.repo

# Enable a repo, you can get the repoId via yum repolist all
yum-config-manager --enable repoId

# Replace the repoId by *, you can enable all repo
yum-config-manager --enable \*

# Disabling a Yum Repository
yum-config-manager --disable repoId
</code>

==== Reset your yum base repo ====

The CentOS 7 base release repo conf is located at "/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo". It contains three parts:
  * Base
  * Extras
  * Updates

If this conf is corrupted, you can no longer download or update packages from the centos 7 base release repo.

You can reset it by doing the following steps

<code>
# erase the corrupted repo, --nodeps means remove centos-release without dependencies
rpm -e centos-release --nodeps

# add the new correct repo
rpm -Uvh http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/centos-release-7-6.1810.2.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

# The above URL may change with time, the best way to get the latest url. Goto http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages, then find the latest centos-release-7 on the page

# You can check the new repo
yum repolist
</code>
