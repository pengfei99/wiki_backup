====== Install vmware tools on a centos7 guest via vmware player ======

The VMware tools enable you to create share folders between guest and host, print in the guest os, etc. So it's nice to have them. In this tutorial, I will show you how to install them.

===== 0. Prerequisites =====

VMware tools are written in perl, and it will use gcc, make, kernel-headers, etc. to compile drivers in your guest OS. In my example, the guest os is centos 7. So you need to install the following dependencies

<code>
# centos 7 
$ sudo yum install perl gcc make kernel-headers kernel-devel -y

# ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code> 

===== 1. Mount the VMware tools cd rom and install=====

In this tutorial, I used VMware workstation 12 player. Open it, click on Player-> Manager -> Install VMware tools.

This will trigger a cd room mount, you should see it on your desktop.

<code>
# blkid list all block device
$ blkid
/dev/sr0: UUID="2017-03-17-07-21-14-00" LABEL="VMware Tools" TYPE="iso9660" 

# create a directory to mount the CD
$ sudo mkdir /media/VMware_Tools
# Mount the CD 
$ sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/VMware_Tools/
# You wiil receive a message that your CD/DVD files should now be accessible read-only

# check the contennt
$ ls -lah /media/VMware_Tools
manifest.txt     VMwareTools-10.1.6-5214329.tar.gz  vmware-tools-upgrader-64
run_upgrader.sh  vmware-tools-upgrader-32

# If you want to make the mount permanent, you can add the following line in your /etc/fstab
UUID=2017-03-17-07-21-14-00             /media/VMware_Tools   iso9660 ro,user,auto  0 0 

# Untar the VMwareTools-10.1.6-5214329.tar.gz,  you should see a folder vmware-tools-distrib

# Run the vmware-install.pl script
$ cd vmware-tools-distrib/
$ ls
bin  caf  doc  etc  FILES  INSTALL  installer  lib  vgauth  vmware-install.pl

$ sudo ./vmware-install.pl
# Follow the instruction, finish the installation 
</code>


===== 2. Create share folder =====

2.1 Create or choose a folder in your Host OS which you want to share with your Guest OS. For example, I choose C:\Users\pliu\Downloads\vm_shareFolder as my share folder.

2.2 Now, I need to go to vmware workstation to config it as share folder.

Click on Player -> Manage -> Virtual Machine Settings -> Options (Tab after Hardware) -> Shared Folders

Now, you just follow the instruction, the share folder is created. 

2.3 Go to your Guest OS, the share folder is mounted on /mnt/hgfs

2.4 Set un a quick access point
$ ln -s /mnt/hgfs/shared-directory ~/Desktop/Name-of-the-folder
