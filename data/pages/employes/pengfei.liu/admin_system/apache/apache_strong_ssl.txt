====== Configure strong SSL on web server ======


This tutorial shows you how to set up strong SSL security on the Apache2 webserver. We do this by updating OpenSSL to the latest version to mitigate attacks like Heartbleed, disabling SSL Compression and EXPORT ciphers to mitigate attacks like FREAK, CRIME and LogJAM, disabling SSLv3 and below because of vulnerabilities in the protocol and we will set up a strong ciphersuite that enables Forward Secrecy when possible. We also enable HSTS and HPKP. This way we have a strong and future proof ssl configuration and we get an A+ on the Qually Labs SSL Test.


Apache configure

# Requires Apache >= 2.4
SSLCompression off
SSLUseStapling on

</code>

nginx config

lighttpd config

===== Warning =====

These examples are meant for sysadmins who have done this before (and sysadmins are forced to support Windows XP with IE < 9, therefore des3cbc), as an easily copy-pastable example, not for newbies who have no idea what all this means. The settings are very secure, but if you don't know what you are doing might make your website and **subdomains unavailable for a long, long time (see HSTS).** Research what you are doing and think before you act.
