====== JAVA Web service ======

===== Soap web service =====

When you generate java code with wsdl, the jvm says ** Failed to read schema document 'xjc.xsd', because 'file' access is not allowed due to the restriction set by the accessExternalSchema property.**

To correct this problem, do the following command.

Create a file named jaxp.properties (if it doesn't exist) under /path/to/jdk1.8.0/jre/lib and then write this line in it:

<code>
javax.xml.accessExternalSchema = all
</code>
