====== The Java naming convention ======

Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.

===== I.1 Class =====

  * It should start with the uppercase letter.
  * It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etc.
  * Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms. Ex: Teacher, Student, Person

===== I.2 Interface =====
 
  * It should start with the uppercase letter.
  * It should be an adjective such as Runnable, Remote, ActionListener.
  * Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms. Ex: Printable, Iterable, Readable

===== I.3 Method =====
 
  * It should start with a lowercase letter.
  * It should be a verb such as main(), print(), println().
  * If the name contains multiple words, start it with a lowercase letter
  * followed by an uppercase letter such as actionPerformed().


===== I.4 Variable =====
 
  * It should start with a lowercase letter such as id, name.
  * It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).
  * If the name contains multiple words, start it with the lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as firstName, lastName.
  * Avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.

===== I.5 Package =====
 
  * It should be a lowercase letter such as java, lang.
  * If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.) such as java.util; java.lang; org.pengfei.ml; com.java;

===== I.6 Constant =====

  * It should be in uppercase letters such as RED, YELLOW.
  * If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(_) such as MAX_PRIORITY.
  * It may contain digits but not as the first letter. Ex: static final int MIN_AGE

===== I.7 CamelCase in java naming conventions =====

  * Java follows camel-case syntax for naming the class, interface, method, and variable.
  * If the name is combined with two words, the second word will start with uppercase letter always such as actionPerformed(), firstName, ActionEvent, ActionListener, etc.
