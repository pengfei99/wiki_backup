====== Installation =====

Here is a short list of some features available in Zabbix:
auto-discovery of servers and network devices
low-level discovery
distributed monitoring with centralized web administration
support for both polling and trapping mechanisms
agent-less monitoring
secure user authentication
flexible user permissions
web-based interface
flexible e-mail notification of predefined events
high-level (business) view of monitored resources
audit log
In this tutorial we show you how to get a Zabbix server, the Zabbix agents and the Zabbix frontend running on FreeBSD.
Root access is required to edit the following files and to execute commands. Log in as root (su) or simply prepend sudo to all commands that require root privileges.
Install Zabbix Server
I have choosen the default installation options without IPV6.
cd /usr/ports/net-mgmt/zabbix-server
make install clean; rehash
The Zabbix server needs a database to save the statistics and settings. For this we will create zabbix as database and database user in MySQL. This instruction assumes that you have a MySQL server running. Please replace PASSWORD with your prefered database password.
mysql -u root -p
create database zabbix;
grant all privileges on zabbix.* to zabbix@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';
flush privileges;
quit
Now that the database is ready we can populate the default layout and data into the database.
cd /usr/local/share/zabbix/server/create
cat schema/mysql.sql data/data.sql data/images_mysql.sql | mysql -u zabbix -p zabbix
The next step is to configure the Zabbix server. First you need to copy the default server configuration.
cd /usr/local/etc/zabbix
cp zabbix_server.conf.sample zabbix_server.conf
In the zabbix_server.conf you need to change the backend settings. At least uncomment and change the database settings. Please replace PASSWORD with your database password.
DBHost=localhost
DBName=zabbix
DBUser=zabbix
DBPassword=PASSWORD
Run the following commands to allocate enough memory.
sysctl kern.ipc.shmall=409600
sysctl kern.ipc.shmmax=204800000
Add the startup value to the rc.conf and start the server.
echo "zabbix_server_enable=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zabbix_server start
Install Zabbix Agent
Now install the Zabbix agent on every client you want to track with the server. Again I have choosen the default installation options without IPV6.
cd /usr/ports/net-mgmt/zabbix-agent
make install clean; rehash
The next step is to configure the Zabbix agent. First you need to copy the default agent configuration.
cd /usr/local/etc/zabbix
cp zabbix_agentd.conf.sample zabbix_agentd.conf
In the zabbix_agentd.conf you need to change the server value. Replace the IP address with the IP address of your Zabbix server.
Server=123.123.123.123
Add the startup value to the rc.conf and start the agent.
echo "zabbix_agentd_enable=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zabbix_agentd start
Install Zabbix Frontend
After the installation of the Zabbix server and the Zabbix agents we will install the frontend on the same backend we used for the Zabbix server.
cd /usr/ports/net-mgmt/zabbix-frontend
make install clean; rehash
Now you can add /usr/local/www/zabbix as a vhost or move it to your prefered location. The following is an example of a server block for Zabbix in Nginx. This example makes the Zabbix frontend accessible on localhost:82. Please change it to your requirements.
server {
        listen 82;
        server_name localhost;
        location / {
            root /usr/local/www/zabbix;
            index index.php index.html index.htm;
        }
        location ~ \.php$ {
            root /usr/local/www/zabbix;
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /usr/local/www/zabbix$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }
        location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all;
        }
}
Finally you can access the Zabbix frontend and start the setup. Follow the installation and make the required changes in your php.ini. After finishing the setup you can login with the user: admin and password: zabbix. Please change the password under Administration -> Users -> Admin. The official Zabbix documentation can be found here.
